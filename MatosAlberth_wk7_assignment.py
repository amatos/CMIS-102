# This Python program:
#   This week's assignment involves writing a Python program to collect all the data of a road trip and calculate each person's share of the cost. Prompt the user for each of the following:
#
# The number of people on the trip.
# The number of days of the trip.
# For each day of the trip:
# Cost of food.
# Cost of gas.
# The food and gas costs should be stored in two separate arrays. Calculate and display each of the following:
#
# the total cost of each category;
# the total cost of the trip; and
# each person's share of the total cost.
